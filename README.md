<h1>Rube Goldberg Machine</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Utilized Autodesk Fusion360 CAD program to create parts and assembly for an innovative, more sustainable product idea. The product idea is the EcoTowel, which is a reusable paper towel dispenser that uses UV light technology to clean the towel once it is fed back into
the dispenser. After the models and assembly were created, engineering drawings and a bill of materials were produced as well.
