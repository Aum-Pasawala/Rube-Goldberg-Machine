<h1>Rube Goldberg Machine</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
Built a Rube Goldberg machine with 10 unique steps, all components designed for 3D printing. The project applied DFM principles, including material selection, geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), and design for assembly (DFA) to ensure efficient manufacturing and assembly. I utilized various techniques learned in the lab, such as injection molding and CNC machining, to produce precise and functional parts. This hands-on project helped me understand how theoretical DFM concepts are applied in real-world design and manufacturing.
